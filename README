What is this
============

My Nabaztag is sad as Violet has shut down their service. So I decided to do something to make it happy again.
This repo is a collection of various apps and tools to provide local services for Nabaztag bunnies.


Tools
=====

* RabbitSociety - A Ruby on Rails app providing web service for the bunnies.
* flamontagne-fleebie_weather-tip - experimental XMPP client based on this article http://www.rubyfleebie.com/xmpp4r-a-real-world-example/

* openfire - Jabber server. Grab it from here: http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/


Status
======

Actually bunny boots up but fails logging in (there's no service to authenticate yet).
